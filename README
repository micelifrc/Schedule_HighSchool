This program will use boolean LP to create a schedule for teachers->classes in an high school.

The program will be called as:
$ ./Schedule_HighSchool.out <input.txt>

And will print two files called "classes_schedule.pdf" and "teacher_schedule.txt" with the output schedule.

<input.txt> will contain the following 3 types of lines:

Each line starting with the character 'c' will contain an id uniquely identifying a class, then the name of the class
(without spaces), and then the number of  hours of the class for each school day.
For example, if the school week lasts 6 days (from Monday to Saturday), and class 5E has 6 hours on Tuesday and Friday,
5 hours on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday, and 4 hours on Saturday, then the input.txt file will contain the following
line:

c 37 5E 5 6 5 5 6 4

where 37 is an ID for class 5E.

Each line starting with the character 't' will contain an id uniquely identifying a teacher, then the name of the
teacher (without spaces), and a "penality number" for each hour of the school-weak.
For example, if the school weak has 6 days, and each day lasts 6 hours (apart from Saturday which lasts 5), then the
line for a teacher will look like the following:

t 21 Miceli 4 0 0 0 2 5  3 0 0 0 1 4  3 0 0 0 1 4  3 0 0 0 1 4  3 0 0 0 1 4  3 0 0 0 4

This denotes that the teacher Miceli has id 21. The 6+6+6+6+6+5=35 numberes that follow denotes how much the teacher
would like to be at home in the associated hour.
This means that Miceli would prefer not to be at school in the first and last hour of each day (and possibly also on the
fifth hour).
If a teacher is totally unavailable at a certain hour (for example if he is a part-timer), then he should write -1 on
that hour. This should be confirmed by the headmaster.
The sum of the penality numbers >= 0 must be <= 50.

Each line starting with a 'q' will contain a "query" for a teacher for a class.
The line will contain the 2 id's of the teacher and the class (teacher first), followed by the number of hours the
teacher has in the class, and finally the number of days in which the teacher wants to have 2 consecutive hours in the
class (for example to do written tests, or for PE teachers).
An example of teacher Miceli for class 5E would be:

q 21 37 5 1

This denotes that Miceli has 5 hours with the class 5E, and wants to have 1 day with 2 consecutive hours (in order to do
the written tests).
